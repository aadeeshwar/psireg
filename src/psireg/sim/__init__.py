"""Simulation module for PSIREG renewable energy grid system.

This module provides the core simulation engine that evolves grid state with minimal physics,
including network topology, power flow balance, frequency/voltage tracking, and asset scheduling.
It also includes comprehensive data pipeline functionality for weather and demand data.
